This project seeks to reform the housing search process in Boston through a holistic data-driven approach, encompassing web crawling, real-time dashboarding, and automated deployment. Python, in conjunction with a variety of libraries, was employed for the purpose of web scraping and data preparation. The extracted data was seamlessly connected to an SQLite database, establishing a link with Tableau for a live dashboard experience. Additionally, a modified version of the Python code was deployed on an Azure Databricks server using PySpark, enabling dynamic real-time connections to Tableau Cloud.

This innovative approach empowers end users to effortlessly access a comprehensive dashboard, facilitating exploration of available housing options, evaluation of rental trends, and ultimately facilitating the discovery of homes that align with their unique requirements and preferences.
